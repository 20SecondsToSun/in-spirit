[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector The Canny edge detection operator was developed by John F. Canny in 1986 and uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images.]

*[http://blog.inspirit.ru/?p=297 Test demonstration application (pure AS3 version)]*

*[http://blog.inspirit.ru/?p=336 Small explanation of Alchemy version]*

=== Usage info ===

{{{
// init Canny Detector instance
// i would recommend pre-init instance outside loops for better performance
// you can change source Image at anytime using "source" property

var canny:CannyEdgeDetector = new CannyEdgeDetector(sourceImage);

// run Edges detection
// please note that source image should be GrayScaled before you run
// detection process. (only BLUE channel data is used)
// Edges would be outputted into provided edgesImage BitmapData object

// you also can control different detection options (via properties):
// blurSize - if you want source to be blurred before detection
// lowThreshold - min edges threshold value to be processed
// highThreshold - max edges threshold value to be processed

canny.detectEdges(edgesImage);

// always clear instance memory usage if you don't plan to use it any more

canny.dispose();
