This is a class for solving real-time fluid dynamics simulations based on Navier-Stokes equations and code from Jos Stam's paper [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"]

Original implementation in C++ done by [http://www.memo.tv Memo Akten]
